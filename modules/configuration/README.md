# Configuration Module

## Description

The Configuration module is responsible for managing and providing access to all configuration settings required by the Privacy Risk Assessor application. This includes sensitive information like database connection strings and API keys, as well as operational parameters such as logging levels, default settings for the analytics engine, and external service URLs. Centralizing configuration management makes the application more maintainable, adaptable to different environments (development, testing, production), and secure.

## Key Components

*   **`configHelper.js`**: This is likely the central piece of the module. It would typically include:
    *   Logic to load configuration data from various sources (e.g., environment variables, JSON files, YAML files, `.env` files).
    *   Functions to parse and validate loaded configuration values.
    *   A mechanism to provide other modules with easy access to specific configuration settings (e.g., `getConfig('database.url')`).
    *   Potentially, methods to handle default values if certain configurations are not explicitly set.
    *   Logic for managing environment-specific configurations (e.g., loading `config.development.json` or `config.production.json`).

## Interactions

The Configuration module is a foundational component that primarily serves other modules:

*   **All Other Modules (`API`, `Database`, `Analytics`, `Orchestration`, `Navigation`, `Sites`, etc.)**: Virtually every other module in the application will interact with the Configuration module. They will request specific configuration values needed for their operation, such as:
    *   `Database` module needing connection strings and credentials.
    *   `API` module needing port numbers, rate limits, or security settings.
    *   `Analytics` module needing parameters for risk assessment, or URLs/keys for external threat intelligence feeds.
    *   `Orchestration` module needing queue settings or worker configurations.
*   **Application Startup**: The Configuration module is typically one of the first to be initialized during application startup to ensure all settings are available before other components are set up.

This module generally does not initiate actions in other modules but rather responds to requests for configuration data.
