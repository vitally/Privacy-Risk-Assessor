# API Module

## Description

The API module provides the external interface for the Privacy Risk Assessor application. It is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, routing them to the appropriate backend services, validating input, authenticating and authorizing requests (if applicable), and formatting the responses to be sent back to the client. This module enables programmatic interaction with the system, allowing users or other services to initiate website scans, retrieve analysis reports, and manage application settings.

## Key Components

*   **`apiHelper.js`**: This file likely contains essential helper functions and logic for the API module. This could include:
    *   Definitions of API routes and endpoints (e.g., `/scan`, `/report/{id}`).
    *   Request validation logic (e.g., checking parameters, request body).
    *   Response formatting utilities.
    *   Middleware for common tasks like logging, authentication, or error handling.
    *   Functions to interact with other modules (e.g., calling the Orchestration module to start a scan).

## Interactions

The API module is a central hub and interacts with various other modules:

*   **Clients (External/UI)**: Receives HTTP requests from external clients, which could be a web-based user interface, command-line tools, or other third-party applications.
*   **`Orchestration` Module**: Forwards requests to initiate new privacy risk assessments or manage existing ones to the Orchestration module.
*   **`Database` Module**: Queries the Database module to retrieve data such as stored analysis reports, website information, or user account details. It may also store API usage logs or client-specific settings.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: Fetches configuration settings relevant to API operation, such as rate limits, authentication parameters, or logging levels.
*   **`Analytics` Module**: While direct interaction might be limited (often mediated by Orchestration), the API module exposes the results generated by the Analytics module.
