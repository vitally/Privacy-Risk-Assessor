# Docs Module

## Description

The Docs module is responsible for generating and managing documents, likely reports related to the privacy risk assessments. Given the presence of a `.docx` template, this module probably populates templates with data from analyses to create user-friendly, downloadable reports in Microsoft Word format. These reports could summarize findings, detail identified risks, and provide recommendations.

## Key Components

*   **`documentHelper.js`**: This file is expected to contain the core logic for document generation. This might include:
    *   Functions to load and parse the `.docx` template.
    *   Methods to populate placeholders or fields within the template with specific data (e.g., scan results, website details, risk scores).
    *   Logic to save the populated template as a new `.docx` file.
    *   Potentially, functions to convert documents to other formats (though this is less certain).
*   **`dviTemplate.docx`**: This is a Microsoft Word template file. The name "dvi" might suggest "Data Visit Information," "Data Violation Incident," or a similar term related to privacy and data. This template defines the structure and layout of the generated reports.

## Interactions

The Docs module likely interacts with several other parts of the application:

*   **`Analytics` Module**: Retrieves detailed findings and data from the Analytics module to populate the reports.
*   **`Database` Module**: May fetch stored analysis results or website information from the Database module to be included in the documents.
*   **`API` Module**: The API module might expose endpoints that allow users to trigger the generation of these documents or download previously generated ones.
*   **`Orchestration` Module**: The Orchestration module could initiate the document generation process as one of the final steps in a website analysis workflow. For instance, after an analysis is completed and results are stored, orchestration might call this module to create a summary report.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: May use settings from the Configuration module, for example, to define paths for saving generated documents or to get metadata to include in the reports.
