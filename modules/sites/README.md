# Sites Module

## Description

The Sites module is responsible for managing information and operations related to specific websites. This includes fetching metadata about websites, such as WHOIS information, and managing lists of sites, for example, maintaining a list of most popular websites for proactive scanning or analysis. It centralizes functionalities that deal with website identity and characteristics beyond just their URLs.

## Key Components

*   **`mostPopularSiteHelper.js`**: This file likely contains logic to retrieve, manage, or provide access to a list of "most popular" websites. This list could be sourced from:
    *   External public lists (e.g., Tranco, Alexa top sites).
    *   Internal curated lists.
    *   This helper might be used by the `orchestration` module's `popularSiteRetriever.js`.
*   **`whoisHelper.js`**: This component is designed to perform WHOIS lookups for domain names. WHOIS lookups retrieve registration information about a domain, including owner details, contact information, and registrar details. This information can be valuable for:
    *   Understanding the entity behind a website.
    *   Supporting privacy risk assessments by providing context about a site's operator.

## Interactions

The Sites module interacts with other parts of the application to provide and manage website-related information:

*   **`Orchestration` Module**: The Orchestration module, particularly components like `popularSiteRetriever.js`, may use `mostPopularSiteHelper.js` from this module to get lists of websites to queue for scanning. WHOIS information might also be retrieved during the orchestration process.
*   **`Analytics` Module**: Information gathered by the Sites module, such as WHOIS data, could be used by the Analytics module as part of its risk assessment. For example, the reputation or location of a domain owner might be a relevant data point.
*   **`Database` Module**: May store and retrieve lists of sites, WHOIS lookup results, and other site-specific metadata in the database.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: Might use configuration settings for:
    *   URLs or API keys for external services used to fetch popular site lists.
    *   Configuration for WHOIS lookup services (e.g., specific servers, retry mechanisms).
*   **`API` Module**: Potentially, the API module could expose endpoints allowing users to query WHOIS information or manage lists of sites, leveraging the functionalities within this Sites module.

This module helps in gathering contextual information about websites, which can enrich the overall privacy analysis process.
