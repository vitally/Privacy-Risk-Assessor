# Database Module

## Description

The Database module is responsible for all data persistence and management for the Privacy Risk Assessor application. It abstracts the underlying database technology (MongoDB) and provides a clean interface for other modules to interact with the stored data. This includes storing information about websites, scan configurations, analysis results, user accounts (if applicable), and any other data critical to the application's functionality.

## Key Components

*   **`databaseClient.js`** (assuming this is the intended name for `databseClient.js`): This file is likely responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the MongoDB server. It may handle:
    *   Connecting to the database using connection strings from the `Configuration` module.
    *   Managing connection pools for efficient database access.
    *   Handling database connection events (e.g., connect, disconnect, error).
*   **`databaseHelper.js`**: This file probably contains helper functions and utilities for performing common database operations. This could include:
    *   CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various data models (e.g., websites, scan reports).
    *   Functions for querying the database with specific criteria.
    *   Data serialization and deserialization logic.
    *   Index management or schema definitions (though MongoDB is schema-less, Mongoose or similar ODMs might be used to enforce structure).

## Interactions

The Database module is a core service module that interacts extensively with other parts of the application:

*   **`API` Module**: The API module queries the Database module to retrieve data requested by clients, such as scan reports, lists of scanned websites, or user profile information. It may also store new data through the Database module, like user-generated configurations.
*   **`Analytics` Module**: Stores the detailed results of privacy risk analyses in the database. It might also retrieve historical data or configuration parameters (like risk scoring rules or known tracker lists) from the database.
*   **`Orchestration` Module**: Stores and updates the status of ongoing and completed scans. It also retrieves information about websites queued for analysis and may log orchestration events.
*   **`Sites` Module**: Stores and retrieves information related to websites, such as lists of popular sites, WHOIS data, or site-specific metadata.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: The Database module itself relies on the Configuration module to obtain necessary settings for connecting to MongoDB (e.g., connection URI, database name, credentials).

This module typically does not initiate actions in other modules but responds to data storage and retrieval requests.
