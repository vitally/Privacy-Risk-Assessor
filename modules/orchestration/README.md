# Orchestration Module

## Description

The Orchestration module acts as the central coordinator for the Privacy Risk Assessor application. It manages the end-to-end workflow of a website privacy assessment. This includes receiving scan requests, queuing websites for analysis, managing worker processes for concurrent scans, initiating data collection by the Navigation module, triggering the Analytics module to perform risk assessment, and ensuring that results are appropriately stored in the database and reports (if any) are generated.

## Key Components

*   **`workerFactory.js`**: This file likely implements a system for creating and managing "workers". Each worker might be responsible for handling the scan of a single website or a part of the analysis process. This allows for concurrent processing of multiple scan requests, improving throughput and efficiency.
*   **`popularSiteRetriever.js`**: This component seems responsible for fetching lists of popular websites. These lists might be used to proactively scan well-known sites, provide a default set for analysis, or for research purposes. It could fetch these lists from external sources or a pre-defined internal list.
*   **`popularSiteVisitor.js`**: This component likely orchestrates the process of visiting and analyzing the websites retrieved by `popularSiteRetriever.js`. It would coordinate with the `Navigation` module to visit the sites and the `Analytics` module to process the findings for these popular sites.

Other implicit components might include:
*   A queueing mechanism (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or an in-memory queue) to manage websites awaiting scans.
*   Logic for scheduling and prioritizing scans.
*   Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed scan attempts.

## Interactions

The Orchestration module is highly interconnected and directs the flow of operations:

*   **`API` Module**: Receives scan initiation requests (e.g., a URL to scan) from the API module. It also provides status updates on ongoing or completed scans back to the API module.
*   **`Navigation` Module**: Instructs the Navigation module to visit specific websites and collect necessary data (e.g., web requests, responses, scripts).
*   **`Analytics` Module**: Passes the data collected by the Navigation module to the Analytics module for privacy risk identification and scoring.
*   **`Database` Module**: Stores and updates the status of scan jobs (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed, failed) in the database. It also instructs the Database module to save the final analysis results.
*   **`Sites` Module**: May interact with the Sites module to fetch lists of websites to scan (e.g., using `popularSiteRetriever.js` which might use helpers from `Sites`) or to update site-specific information.
*   **`Docs` Module**: May trigger the Docs module to generate a detailed report once a scan and analysis are complete.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: Relies on the Configuration module for various operational settings, such as queue configurations, number of concurrent workers, retry policies, and URLs for external services (like sources for popular sites).

This module effectively "conducts" the other modules to perform a complete privacy assessment.
