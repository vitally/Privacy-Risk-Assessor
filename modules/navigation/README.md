# Navigation Module

## Description

The Navigation module is responsible for programmatically navigating websites to collect data for privacy risk analysis. This involves managing URLs, controlling a browser (likely headless), and handling various aspects of web page interaction to ensure comprehensive data gathering. Its goal is to simulate user browsing behavior to capture the web requests, responses, and dynamic content generated by a site.

## Key Components

*   **`navigationHelper.js`**: This file likely contains helper functions and logic to manage the browser instance and navigation process. This could include:
    *   Functions to launch and control a headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer, Playwright).
    *   Methods for handling page loading, timeouts, and errors during navigation.
    *   Utilities for interacting with page elements (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling) if the analysis requires deeper interaction.
    *   Functions for managing browser context, such as cookies, cache, and local storage.
    *   Setting user-agent strings or other browser headers.
*   **`urlHelper.js`**: This file probably provides utilities for managing and processing URLs. This might include:
    *   Functions for URL parsing, validation, and normalization.
    *   Logic for managing queues or lists of URLs to visit (e.g., discovering new URLs from a page).
    *   Handling of URL parameters and fragments.
    *   Detecting and managing redirects.

## Interactions

The Navigation module plays a crucial role in the data collection phase and interacts with:

*   **`Orchestration` Module**: Receives target website URLs and navigation tasks from the Orchestration module. It executes these tasks and returns the collected data (e.g., HAR files, page content) to the Orchestration module for further processing.
*   **`Analytics` Module**: The data collected by the Navigation module (web requests, JavaScript files, etc.) is the primary input for the Analytics module, which then inspects this data for privacy risks.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: Retrieves configuration settings that affect navigation behavior, such as:
    *   Browser settings (e.g., which browser to use, headless mode).
    *   Navigation timeouts.
    *   User-agent strings to be used.
    *   Rules for interaction (e.g., depth of crawling).
*   **`Sites` Module**: May receive URLs from the Sites module (e.g., a list of popular sites to scan).

This module is primarily activated by the Orchestration module and provides data that fuels the Analytics module.
