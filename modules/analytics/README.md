# Analytics Module

## Description

The Analytics module is responsible for performing the detailed analysis of website data to identify potential privacy risks. It examines web requests, responses, and website content (like scripts and cookies) to detect patterns and practices that could compromise user privacy. This includes identifying third-party trackers, analyzing data transmission security (e.g., use of HTTPS), checking for data leakage, and assessing cookie usage.

## Key Components

*   **`analyticsHelper.js`**: This file likely contains the core functions and logic for conducting the privacy risk analysis. It may include:
    *   Functions to parse and inspect HTTP requests and responses.
    *   Logic to identify known tracking scripts or domains.
    *   Methods to analyze cookie attributes for security and privacy implications.
    *   Functions to score or categorize identified risks.

## Interactions

The Analytics module interacts with several other parts of the application:

*   **`Orchestration` Module**: Receives tasks or data (e.g., collected web requests for a specific site) from the Orchestration module, which manages the overall scanning and analysis workflow.
*   **`Database` Module**: May store the results of its analysis (e.g., identified risks, scores) in the database. It might also retrieve configuration settings, analysis rules, or known tracker lists from the database.
*   **`API` Module**: The findings and reports generated by the Analytics module are ultimately made available to the user or other systems through the API module.
*   **`Configuration` Module**: May use configurations (e.g., risk thresholds, lists of known trackers) provided by the Configuration module to guide its analysis.
