# Privacy Risk Assessor

## Overview

The Privacy Risk Assessor is a tool designed to analyze website web requests to identify potential privacy risks. It helps users understand how websites handle their data, highlighting practices such as data leakage, insecure data transmission, and the use of third-party trackers. By providing insights into these risks, the project aims to promote greater transparency and empower users to make informed decisions about their online privacy.

## Architecture

The project is composed of several key modules, each located within the `modules/` directory:

*   **API (`modules/api`):** This module serves as the main entry point for interacting with the Privacy Risk Assessor. It handles incoming requests, manages user authentication (if applicable), and provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for initiating scans, retrieving analysis reports, and managing settings.
*   **Database (`modules/database`):** This module is responsible for data persistence. It stores information about the websites to be analyzed, the results of privacy risk assessments, user accounts, and any other relevant data required for the application's operation. MongoDB is used as the database technology.
*   **Analytics Engine (`modules/analytics`):** The core of the risk assessment process. This module takes the web request data collected from a website and applies various analysis techniques to identify potential privacy vulnerabilities. This includes checking for insecure protocols, identifying known trackers, analyzing data transmission patterns, and flagging suspicious scripts.
*   **Orchestration (`modules/orchestration`):** This module coordinates the overall workflow of a privacy risk assessment. It manages tasks such as queuing websites for scanning, initiating the data collection process, triggering the analytics engine, and ensuring that results are stored correctly in the database and made available via the API.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Privacy Risk Assessor, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
    *   Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. You may need to configure it according to your environment.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Navigate to the `lwc-ui` folder (if it exists for a Lightning Web Components UI) and run:
        ```bash
        cd lwc-ui
        npm install
        cd ..
        ```

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application components:

1.  **Start MongoDB:**
    *   Ensure your MongoDB server is running. If you have a specific configuration file, you can use it. For example:
        ```bash
        mongod -f ./config/mongod.conf
        ```
    *   (If you don't have a `mongod.conf`, you might just run `mongod` or your system's command to start the MongoDB service.)

2.  **Start the Server Node (Backend API):**
    *   In the project's root directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   This will typically start the backend API server.

3.  **Start the UI Node (Frontend):**
    *   If you have a UI component (e.g., in an `lwc-ui` folder), navigate to that folder and run its start command. For example:
        ```bash
        cd lwc-ui
        npm run serve
        ```
    *   This will typically start the frontend development server.

## Usage

This section should detail how to use the Privacy Risk Assessor. This includes:

*   **Accessing the UI:** How to open the web interface (e.g., `http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER` for the UI).
*   **Using the API:**
    *   Available API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/scan`, `GET /api/reports/{scanId}`).
    *   Request/response formats.
    *   Authentication methods (if any).

*(This section should be updated with specific details as the API and UI are developed.)*
